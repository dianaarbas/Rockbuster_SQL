# Rockbuster_SQL

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. 

## Objective

I am collaborating with Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. I loaded all of Rockbuster’s data into an RDBMS. Then, I used SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have. 

## Data

The dataset was provided by Rockbuster in the Project Brief and contained the following information:

### Fact Tables
- Payment
- Rental

### Dimension Tables
- Actor
- Address
- Category
- City
- Country
- Customer
- Fim
- Film Actor
- Film Category
- Inventory
- Language
- Staff
- Store

## Visualization

A visualization was created in Tableau: [Map of Total Payments and Customer Counts](https://public.tableau.com/shared/K5J6DJF6X?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
